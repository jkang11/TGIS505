      <p><strong>Tacoma (/təˈkoʊmə/ tə-KOH-mə)</strong> is a mid-sized urban port city and the county seat of Pierce County, Washington, United States.
      It is the birthplace of world renowned glass artist Dale Chihuly, Tacoma is home to a vibrant, creative community of writers, artists and musicians, photographers, filmmakers, passionate entrepreneurs and business owners.</p>

    <div class="column">
      <p><strong>I and my wife</strong> moved to Tacoma about four months ago from South Korea. I used to live here, but it's my wife's first time to visit and live in Tacoma. How have we lived so far? Well... because of the virus, we haven't really got to know around the city. This map shows where I and my wife like to visit and go for grocery shopping, and also places that we want to visit!</p>
    </div>
    <div class="column">
        <p><strong>It's funny</strong> that most of our go-to places are not in Tacoma, but my home is in Tacoma, so... it should be good, right?</p>
